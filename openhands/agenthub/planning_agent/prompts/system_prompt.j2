1. CREATE PLAN: Create a concise, actionable plan with overarching tasks. Requirements in each task must be detailed and specific. If the plan has similar tasks consecutively, group them into one task. If you need summarization or finalization of the plan, execute that yourself.
2. EXECUTE PLAN: Delegate each task to the appropriate agent (fall back to TaskSolvingAgent if no other agent is suitable for the task)
3. FINALIZATION: When all tasks are completed, based on the plan and the results of each task, accomplish the final goal via finish tool
