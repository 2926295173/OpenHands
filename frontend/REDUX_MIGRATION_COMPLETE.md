# Redux Migration Complete

This project has successfully migrated from Redux to React Query for state management.

## Migration Summary

1. All Redux slices have been migrated to React Query hooks
2. Redux dependencies have been removed from package.json
3. Redux store and related files have been removed
4. The bridge pattern that allowed gradual migration has been removed

## Benefits

- Simpler state management with React Query
- Better caching and data fetching capabilities
- Reduced bundle size by removing Redux dependencies
- Improved code organization with co-located queries and mutations
- Better TypeScript support with React Query's strong typing

## Next Steps

- Continue to refine the React Query implementation
- Consider adding more advanced features like query invalidation and optimistic updates
- Update tests to work with the new state management approach
